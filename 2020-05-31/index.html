    <p>In junior college, we had this department called the career guidance office. Their only purpose was to help students with their university applications because it can be overwhelming when you're new to applying to universities. When the time came for me to apply to one, I sent the office administrator an email to setup my account (new system and accounts had to be manually created). </p>
    <p>My email went something like this:</p>
    <div id="email">
    <p>K: Hello, can you create an account for me? Thanks</p>
    <p>A: We have just completed an application cycle. May I know which cycle you're applying for?</p>
    <p>K: This year's admissions cycle</p>
    <p>A: We are unable to create account for admission 2020 as we have just completed sending the US applications</p>
    <p>K: Ok so how should I do this year's applications</p>
    <p>K: I'm referring to the application cycle that starts at the end of this year</p>
    <p>A: Please check our website regularly for updates on application timelines and deadlines</p>
    <p>A: Please email us in July to create the account for you</p>
    </div>
    <p>It's annoying for everyone involved. The administrator has probably answered hundreds of similar queries over the past few years. The time definitely racks up having to support students through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_communication#Electronically_mediated_communication">asynchronous</a> communications.</p>
    <p>So let machines handle the boring stuff! These are what bots are best at doing. The current language models can understand factive questions with great accuracy and they're available to download for free on <a href="https://github.com/nltk/nltk">github</a>.
    <p>Just clone and go.</p>
