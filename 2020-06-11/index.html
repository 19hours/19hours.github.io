    <h1>Tracking Singapore law with git</h1>
    <p class="light">
      June 11, 2020
    </p>
    <p>Because the elections are coming, I tried to understand what laws were introduced and what changes were made to
      the laws since the last election. I visited <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/">sso.agc.gov.sg</a> and they have
      this timeline box on each page and you have to select a date to see a version of the statute. There was no way to
      compare different versions on the same screen.</p>
    <p>Today, I created a <a href="https://github.com/19hours/sg-statutes">git repository</a> to track all changes to
      the statutes.</p>
    <p><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control">Git</a> is a version control
      system that records changes to a set of files over time. Combined with markdown, it becomes simple to see all
      changes made to a statute.</p>
    <p>Behind the scenes, the documents on sso.agc are word-converted pages. That means you would have a table in a
      table in a table to display a line of text. There were too many small differences in the statute documents to
      cover every edge case so some of mine have unformatted text as a fallback.</p>
    <p>This is a small step in my goal to create a powerful legal application on desktop. Please drop me an <a
        href="mailto:kevinchuwinghim@gmail.com?subject=Hello">email</a> if you're a law student or lawyer. I want to
      solve your problems.</p>
